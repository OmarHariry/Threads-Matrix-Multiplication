# Threads-Matrix-Multiplication
It is required to implement two variations of this algorithm:
a) The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
b) The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
For both variations, you have to compute the elapsed time for each of them, compare them and justify your answer.
The program should read two input matrices in a certain format.
Compile the program using: g++ pthread main.cpp -o .x
